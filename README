Turbux is designed to speed up your TDD cycle by using a single key mapping to run the most relevant test based on the current file in vim. It uses tmux's scriptability to send commands to a chosen pane in your tmux session, by way of tslime.vim.

For more information, see the documentation.

Must be used with tslime.vim, vimscript #3023. Best when used with rails.vim, vimscript #1567.
